AMR_annotation pipeline, built with Snakemake
  Usage: bash start_annotation.sh -i <INPUT_DIR> <parameters>

Input:
  -i, --input [DIR]                 This is the folder containing your input fasta files.
                                    Default is raw_data/

  -o, --output [DIR]                This is the folder containing your output (results) files.
                                    Default is out/ 

  --genus [STR]                     Genus of the samples. Only one can be provided and it will be assumed to be the same one for all 
                                    samples. For example: "--genus Escherichia". Default "Not provided"

  --species [STR]                   Species of the sample (no genus included). Only one can be provided and it will be assumed to be 
                                    the same one for all samples. For example: "--species coli". Default "Not provided"

  --metadata [.csv]                 CSV file with at least 3 columns: "File_name", "Genus" and "Species". Where the "File_name" should 
                                    coincide EXACTLY (case sensitive) with the name of the fasta file of the sample. The genus and the
                                    species they should both be terms accepted in the TaxID system and one single word each. For example:
                                    mysample.fasta, Escherichia, coli. Note that if you use the option --make-metadata, any other metadata
                                    file provided will be ignored.

  --make-metadata                   If this option is chosen, the metadata will be gotten from the file name. Basically, the abbreviation
                                    of some common species are looked for in the file name and they are used to determine the genus and 
                                    species. The accepted abbreviations are: Kpn = Klebsiella pneumoniae, Eco = Escherichia coli, 
                                    Ecl = Enterobacter cloacae, Cfr = Citrobacter freundii, Pae = Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
                                    Sau or Sar = Staphylococcus aureus

  --proteins                        Path to protein database (fasta file with PROTEIN sequences) to be used for annotation with prokka. 
                                    Default is the non-redundant plasmid proteins of the refseq database stored at the RIVM (you only have
                                    access if you are at the RIVM).

Output (automatically generated):
  <output_dir>/                     Contains dir contains the results of every step of the pipeline.

  <output_dir>/log/                 Contains the log files for every step of the pipeline

  <output_dir>/log/drmaa			      Contains the .out and .err files of every job sent to the grid/cluster.

  <output_dir>/log/results		      Contains the log files and parameters that the pipeline used for the current run


Parameters:
  -h, --help                        Print the help document.

  -sh, --snakemake-help             Print the snakemake help document.

  --clean (-y)                      Removes output (-y forces "Yes" on all prompts).

  -n, --dry-run                     Useful snakemake command that displays the steps to be performed without actually 
				                            executing them. Useful to spot any potential issues while running the pipeline.

  -u, --unlock                      Unlocks the working directory. A directory is locked when a run ends abruptly and 
				                            it prevents you from doing subsequent analyses on that directory until it gets unlocked.

  Other snakemake parameters	      Any other parameters will be passed to snakemake. Read snakemake help (-sh) to see
				                            the options.
